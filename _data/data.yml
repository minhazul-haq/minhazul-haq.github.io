    assignments:
      - title: Domain Adaptation for Cell Segmentation
        tagline: "A semantic segmentation model implemented in Python, PyTorch and Keras. Adversarial learning was 
        applied due to the lack of annotations."
                
      - title: Transformers for Cell Segmentation
        tagline: "Visual Transformer (ViT) based semantic segmentation framework implemented in Python and PyTorch.
        Self-supervised learning is used to learn the quantity of cells, which in turn leads to better segmentation performances."
